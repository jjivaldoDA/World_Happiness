# World_Happiness

As part of my master's project at IAE Gustave Eiffel (2021), we analyzed the 2017 World Happiness Report to understand global well-being. This report by the UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network uses indicators like GDP per capita, life expectancy, generosity index, and corruption perception to measure happiness across countries. 

Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with R, we aimed to highlight differences among countries based on these variables and identify key trends.

Our study includes:
Describing the database and relevant statistics.
Data analysis methods and preprocessing.
Presenting and interpreting results.
Concluding overall findings.
